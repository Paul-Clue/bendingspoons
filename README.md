# Bending Spoons Coding Project

## Description

This is the home page UI for a potential workout app. This page was built specifically for the IPhone X screen size. I was given the original UI and told to make an exact replica of it in 2 1/2 hours. This image folder holds a screenshot of the original.

## Instructions

- At the top of this repo click on the button named "Clone"
- Copy the HTTP URL or SSH.
- In the terminal, type `git clone <copied-value>` replace '<copied-value>' with the HTTP, URL, or SSH that you copied from the last step.
- The folder should be in the directory in which you cloned it.
- Open the directory in your file system.
- Locate the index.html file and double click on it to open it in your browser.
- Make to change the screen size on your browser to IPhone X by using your browser's dev tools.
